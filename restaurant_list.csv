1,Pickle & Rye,American,"31 Sheen Ln, East Sheen, London SW14 8AB",5-9pm,https://www.pickleandrye.com/,"Founders Alex and Val met each other by chance, in an unfamiliar environment (two Americans living and traveling in the UK) through a discussion about food, soon realising they shared a deeper connection. As their relationship progressed, so did their belief that good food was as closely connected to family and the comforts of home as it was to travel and adventure. In attempt to marry both, and shortly before marrying each other, Pickle & Rye, a small home-style American café set in East Sheen, London was born. In 2010 in its early days, before there was such a widespread American influence in London, Pickle & Rye was a simple sandwich shop, showcasing the humble sarnie and showing local residents it could be so much more than a piece of rubbery ham slapped in between two slices of lackluster industrial-made bread. The menu focused on homemade ingredients from the pickles to the sauces, to the salt beef, just like Val and Alex’s childhood dictated it should be. As local families started to pile into Pickle & Rye’s cozy, comforting arms in search of truly satisfying sandwiches, Val and Alex knew it was time to expand. Now open for brunch, lunch and dinner Pickle & Rye offers Londoners a true American experience, no gimmicks or formal attire required. Our food fosters a sense of family; made from wholesome, real ingredients, and packed full of flavour. From blueberry pancakes and eggs Benedict to juicy burgers, mouthwatering sandwiches, seasonal pies and baked goods and glorious milkshakes, our food is made fresh to order and served in a relaxed and welcoming environment. At Pickle & Rye we believe good food doesn’t require fancy cutlery or exotic ingredients to be enjoyed, and everyone is always welcome at our table."

8,Terry's Cafe London,British,"158 Great Suffolk St, London SE1 1PE",8am-3pm,https://terryscafe.co.uk/,"Terry came from a modest family of cooks. His Dad was a chef in the Army and his Mum a pastry cook, so naturally he grew up around food. Terry was born and raised in South London and all his family were from Borough, where bomb sites were the playground of his childhood. Like most working class London families at the time, Summer holidays were spent working on the hop farms around Kent collecting hops for the local breweries. During the war Terry was evacuated to Folkstone, where he lived with an Army major and his wife. After the bombs stopped falling, Terry was reunited with the major on a trip down memory Lane which resulted in his ownership of 2 pigs. This quickly turned into a small holding with 2000 pigs. At age 17, Terry got a job at Smithfield meat market, where he learnt the trade of butchery. After a long career in the market, he decided it was time for a change of direction in order he could spend time with his young family. In 1982 he opened what is now known as Terry’s café. With his extensive product knowledge, cooking and butchering skills he produced wonderful home-cooked food using produce from the nearby Smithfield and Borough markets. During his life, Terry was an Ambassador for the local community. He passed on his values and experience to his son, Austin, who was named after Austin’s of Peckham, a former antiques shop located on Rye Lane. Austin has worked at Terry’s since becoming a Saturday boy at the age of 14. Now in his thirties, he plans to move forward with his Dad’s winning formula and continue to promote traditional values and British culture in a positive fashion."

13,The Sichuan Restaurant,Chinese,"14 City Rd, Finsbury, London EC1Y 2AA",12-11pm,http://www.thesichuan.co.uk/,"Chef Zhang and his family have lived for generations in the Chinese city of Chengdu, the place where Sichuan cuisine originated; a talent for cooking runs deep in his blood. Chef Zhang is a third-generation chef, and thus his love for Sichuan cuisine has been cultivated from a very young age. He was trained both by his uncle and grandfather, a grandfather who was appointed as the personal chef for the late Premier of the People’s Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping (邓小平). This adoration for cooking is something that Chef Zhang has embraced and refined across the world. Chef Zhang’s formative training was completed at the prominent Hibiscus Restaurant in Chengdu, and here he was recognised as a raw talent. His enticing food facilitated his appointment as head chef in a variety of establishments in both Beijing and Shanghai, before his move to London. Since this time Chef Zhang’s popularity in the city has been firmly established as his culinary skill and mouth-watering dishes have certainly proved their appeal. In 2005, he was the head chef at BarShu Restaurant, combining authenticity with innovation to create an exciting Sichuanese menu. Only three years later, Chef Zhang was awarded the Gold title at the 5th International Competition of Eat East Food in Beijing. In 2011 Zhang’s achievements were acknowledged further as he was selected to represent the United Kingdom at the Worlds of Flavour Conference, organised by the Culinary Institute of America, where he was asked to showcase the gold standard of Sichuanese food. Later that year he was invited by Fuchsia Dunlop to help prepare her cookbook, ‘Every Grain of Rice: Simple Chinese Home Cooking’, published in 2012. Chef Zhang’s appointment as the head chef of HuTong in The Shard concluded a year of recognition for his outstanding culinary achievements."

From the florally sweet Chrysanthemum Honey to fruity Lemon Kumquat, most of their oriental teas can be served hot or cold to suit your mood – or temperature. Of course, bubble tea of all colours, flavours and sweetnesses can be slurped at Jen Café. Depending on your palate preference, you can go sweet with something like their Iced Mango Pearl Delight, or savoury with Iced Peanut or Sesame Delight. All of which come with the obligatory tapioca balls to disappear up your straw. Food-wise, you’ve got to taste their succulent spicy-pork-and-vegetable-filled Beijing Dumplings, which – should you pass by in the day – can be seen being lovingly crafted in the window. Perfectly pinched parcels of perfection. Outside of this, there’s enough variety on their menu to give many of Chinatown’s restaurants a run for their money. Their barbecue options are especially plentiful. Get your teeth stuck into sticky Honey BBQ Pork or Soya Sauce Octopus, for instance. If you’re after a Brit fix, Jen Café also offer comforting English favourites like Horlicks, Ovaltine, cheese on toast, and scrambled eggs and ham.

Hand-sliced noodles are just one of the traditional ways things are done here, as Canton flies the flag for the Chinese old school in a sea of modern restaurants. One of the area’s oldest restaurants, its status is legendary, testament to their loyal fanbase of customers who’ve been dining here for thirty years. Beef brisket, ribs, roast pork noodle soup, and the ubiquitous crispy duck done reliably well are Canton’s specialties, with some nose-to-tail menu items available to tempt the more adventurous. If you fancy eating according to the seasons, Canton offers four-season-themed set menus for two. Spring features bright, lighter dishes like Lemon Chicken and Beef with Ginger and Spring Onion, while Autumn offers heartier ones such as Deep Fried Crispy Beef and Fried Prawns Sichuan Style. What Canton lacks in show-y glamour (the vibe is no-frills, café style) it makes up for in fabulous food in belly-swelling, generous portion sizes."

They also operated a chartered flights company called Bumi Travel that brought tourists to Malaysia before the emergence of the larger commercial airline companies. Jaafar & Zaharah wanted to bring Malaysia’s favourite past-time to the ever increasing Malaysian community in London and share the unique taste of Malaysia with the rest of the world and what better way than to open one of London’s first traditional authentic malaysian restaurants. For over 30 years, Satay House has been a safe haven for many malaysians and locals. Visitors from around the world including the United States, France, Mexico, Japan, Nigeria have all experienced our food and left feeling mightily satisfied. The Royal family of Brunei are regulars when they are in town as well as many diplomats and politicians, who return to Satay House for a sense of nostalgia. Some celebrities have also been seen enjoying some of the delicious food on offer such as Jimmy Choo, Don Johnson and Michelle Yeoh. Today, their daughter Fatizah Shawal, with help from the family, want to continue the long standing traditions of the restaurant and help create a dining experience that is truly unforgettable."

Throw in a dash of pepper into the mellowness of the pandan leaves now wafting from the mixture, take some persicaria odorata, and that is our daun kesum that gives the character to our dishes such as the laksa, and bits of torch ginger (bunga kantan) in thin slices or throw it whole into the boil; but how much now of the green chilli? This isn’t made-to-measure cooking, this is doing it by the feel, so much so that our chefs know how it looks when it is right, and how it feels and how it tastes to bring out just the right kind of aaaah! For our chefs know that cooking isn’t just bringing food to the table, it is the feeling and the knowing and the sights and sounds that they put into the toil. These aren’t simply food, these are memories of old Malaya. Tukdin’s Flavours of Malaysia, we’re right here when you are."
